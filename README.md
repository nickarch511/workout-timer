## Introduction

Welcome to my workout timer project!

This was a fun little coding project I started right after taking my first computer science course (CMSC131). 

This timer is equipped with a GUI that allows a user to input a workout manually or navigate to a text
file of a given form that would do this. Check out some of the pre-defined workouts for more info 
on the format of input files.

Please watch this video for a functionality demonstration: https://youtu.be/-JzXZLBemjU

## Functionalities

1) Main Timer— a continuous timer that can be paused and restarted without fail. This timer will switch between
   exercises when the time for a given exercise is up. This is the main functionality of the program.
   
2) Sound— this timer will beep at the end of each exercise and a long beep will sound at the end of the entire workout

3) GUI— The graphical user interface allows for seamless use of the timer as explained in the introduction

4) Workout files— the timer allows for users to input workouts of a given form into the program. The code
   will parse through these files and input the workout
   
   
**Check out my code if you would like to see how this was implemented! Keep in mind, this was one of my first projects :D**

Note: the code for the GUI is in WorkoutTimer/src/visual (this is the majority of the program!) and all other code can be found in WorkoutTimer/src/code
